I am currently a researcher at [Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence (BIGAI)](https://eng.bigai.ai/), under the leadership of [Prof. Songchun Zhu](https://zhusongchun.net/). I earned my PhD as an [Outstanding Graduate](优秀毕业生.jpg) from the Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS) at Tsinghua University, which is led by [Prof. Andrew Chi-Chih Yao](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/yao/). Additionally, I was a visiting scholar at CCLS, Columbia University and received my bachelor's degree from the University of Science and Technology of China.
